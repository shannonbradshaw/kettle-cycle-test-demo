> **Status:** Pre-development planning complete. See [product_spec.md](product_spec.md) for full details.

## Setup

### Machine Configuration

Create a `machine.json` file in the project root with your Viam machine details:

```json
{
  "org_id": "your-org-id",
  "location_id": "your-location-id",
  "machine_id": "your-machine-id",
  "machine_address": "your-machine.viam.cloud"
}
```

You can find these values in the Viam app under your machine's settings.
